# Q2-Multiplexer
## Module 
To make a Verilog 4-to-1 Multiplexer, I used the case function to map specific SEL values to its designated output X, which could be A, B, C or D.  
The truth table is as follows:
| SEL | Output X |
| --- | --- |
| 2'b00 | A |
| 2'b01 | B |
| 2'b10 | C |
| 2'b11 | D|

## Testbench & Simulation 
Values were assigned to A, B, C, and D to check multiplexer function.
